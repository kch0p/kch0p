**Thanks for stopping by! Here's a little bit about me:**

I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying an interdisciplinary major combining Data Science, Legal Studies, and Info Tech. I love thinking about big data, user rights, and ethical tech. I have a background in media and adtech, and am currently building out my portfolio and experience with the hope of eventually working in green tech. 

**Current Projects/Interests**

- This semester my classes include data analysis/methodology for predictive policing, data ethics and HCE frameworks, and statistical methods for academic work.

- Currently performing data analysis on one 200k record SFPD dataset, and preparing another 60k record dataset of police stops in the city of Berkeley. 

- Learning SQL, and drafting API request projects (more details coming soon!)

- Reading up on digital privacy and info science from any one of these amazing resources ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/technology/), [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/), [Beacons](https://logicmag.io/beacons/), [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), [Tech Inquiry](https://techinquiry.org/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/category/security/))
- Reading [*Subprime Attention Crisis*](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374538651/subprimeattentioncrisis) by Tim Huang! It's an amazing book.
